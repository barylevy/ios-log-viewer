# OpenAI API Configuration (Optional - for client-side AI chat)
# If not set, user will be prompted to enter their API key in the browser
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Replace 'your-openai-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key

# Note: Since this is a client-side app, it's recommended to let users 
# enter their API key directly in the browser for better security.
